            <p>The Heckler & Koch MK 23, also known as the MK 23 MOD 0, Mark 23, or USSOCOM MARK 23, is a semi-automatic large-frame handgun chambered in.45 ACP that was developed primarily for offensive use. The USSOCOM version of the MK23 included a laser aiming module (LAM) and suppressor. The USSOCOM MK23 was chosen by the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) for special operations units, outperforming its nearest competition, Colt's OHWS. Development of the pistol began in 1991 as special operations officials highlighted the need for a "Offensive Handgun Weapons System—Special Operations Peculiar" and delivery of the pistols began in May 1996 to the special operation units.</p>

To supply the necessary power to propel the pellets or BBs, these cartridges are placed into the revolver's grip.One may usually fire a revolver in either single-action or double-action mode, such as the Umarex Tornado. When using a double action, the shooter pulls the trigger to simultaneously cock and release the hammer. In a single action, the hammer is manually cocked before each shot.</p>

            <h2>Sawed off Double-Barreled shotgun</h2>
            <p>A sawed-off shotgun is a type of shotgun with a shorter gun barrel, usually less than 18 inches (46 cm), and frequently a pistol grip in place of a longer shoulder stock. It is also known as a scattergun, sawn-off shotgun, short-barrelled shotgun, shorty, or boom stick. Although it is a common word, barrels do not technically need to be cut shorter with a saw. Shorter barrels can be produced instead of the more conventional longer barrels. Because of their lower profile and lighter weight, they are therefore simpler to move and hide. Additionally, the weapon's design facilitates maneuverability in confined areas, a trait that military close-quarters combat groups have requested.</p>

                    <h2>Ak-74u</h2>
                    <p>The way the rifle fires and reloads is the same as it is for the AKM.  Through a vent close to the muzzle, rapidly expanding propellant gases are directed into the gas cylinder above the barrel following the ignition of the cartridge primer and propellant. The long-stroke piston and bolt carrier are forced rearward by the build-up of gases inside the gas cylinder. An ejector spur on the bolt carrier rail guide and a cam guide machined into the underside of the bolt carrier rotate the bolt about 35 degrees, unlocking it from the barrel extension via a camming pin on the bolt. There is a pause between the piston's first recoil impulse and the moving assembly's 5.5 mm (0.2 in) of free travel. gas pressures can decrease to a safe level prior to the seal between the chamber and the bolt being ruptured during the bolt unlocking operation. The AK-74, like earlier rifles of the Kalashnikov type, lacks a gas valve; instead, excess gases are vented through a number of radial vents in the gas cylinder. The 5.45×39mm AK-74 bolt has a bigger extractor claw than the 7.62×39mm AKM for better extraction reliability because the Kalashnikov operating system does not offer primary extraction upon bolt rotation. </p>

        <h2>FN FNC</h2>
        <p>Utilizing a rotating bolt locking mechanism with two locking lugs that fit into matching grooves in the barrel extension, the FNC is a selective fire weapon that runs on gas. The interaction of the bolt's cam pin with a camming guide housed in the bolt carrier rotates and unlocks the bolt. All in all, the mechanism has a striking resemblance to the Kalashnikov rifle, albeit with modifications made for improved design and manufacturing techniques. A spring-loaded cover that automatically opens when the cocking handle is pulled back and automatically shuts when it is brought forward covers the back portion of the cocking handle slot, which is carved into the top receiver for the cocking handle.</p>

This variation, which is based on the fully automatic M249 light machine gun, is similar to the M249 in most key aspects except for the firing mechanism and the addition of welded internal components that hinder the conversion to a fully automatic mode. Interestingly, this version still has belt feeding, which is a rare feature in civilian weapons.</p>

        <h2>FIM-92 (Stinger)</h2>
        <p>The FIM-92 Stinger is an American man-portable air-defense system (MANPADS) that fires infrared homing surface-to-air missiles (SAM). It can be configured to fire from a number of ground vehicles as well as helicopters as the Air-to-Air Stinger (ATAS). It first entered service in 1981 and is now employed by the US and 29 other countries' forces. Raytheon Missiles & Defense manufactures it primarily, but Airbus Defence and Space in Germany and Roketsan in Turkey also make it under license.
